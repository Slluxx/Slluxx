# Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

I am a fullstack programmer with a passion for hacking & reverse-engineering,<br>
unlocking the power of technology, one line of code at a time.


With over a decade of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in creating efficient, well-designed full stack applications.

Driven by my passion for hacking, reverse-engineering, and AI, I am always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what is possible with technology. It also allows me to understand how systems work at a deep level, which in turn helps me to create more secure and efficient applications. Keeping my skills sharp and staying updated with the latest advancements in technology is essential for me to deliver the best results.

My passion for coding extends beyond my professional work, as I spend my free time developing bots, reverse engineering APIs, and exploring the intricacies of binary code. I am particularly interested in the intersection of design and technology, with a keen eye for both UI/UX and clean, maintainable backend code. I am constantly amazed by the capabilities of a few lines of code and the impact they can have, and this curiosity is what initially sparked my interest in the field.
